                </h2>
                <p style="color:blue">1) Tree Lighting Ceremony<br>

                    The holidays wouldn’t be the same without dazzling Christmas trees. From festive lights to colorful
                    ornaments, plan to go see your community’s Christmas tree lighting ceremony! And no matter where you
                    are, you can always stream the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting.<br><br>

                    2) Festive Holiday Restaurant<br>
                    Make a reservation with the people you love at a decorated restaurant full of lights and ornaments
                    galore. Rolf’s in NYC is a classic place to eat and drink during the holidays because of their
                    spectacular Christmas décor!<br><br>

                    3) Cookie Exchange<br>
                    If you want to forgo the gifts and white elephant exchanges, try having a cookie exchange where
                    everyone bakes holiday cookies and swaps!<br><br>

                   

                    4) Holiday Market<br>
                    Get ready for Christmas by visiting a holiday market! Check out the festive shops, sip on hot
                    chocolate, listen to Christmas music and more all in one place. This can be a great place to get
                    some shopping done, while participating in all the Christmas fun.<br><br>

                    5) Go Ice Skating<br>
                    There is no activity quite like ice skating to get you in the holiday mood. Make it a tradition
                    every year to lace up your skates for a fun outing with the family. Plus, you'll likely get to see a
                    grand Christmas tree and listen to festive music while hitting the ice.<br><br>

                    6) Make Hot Chocolate<br>
                    Skip the instant hot chocolate packets and make a decadent hot cocoa that is extra special for the
                    holidays. Kids will love sipping on this sweet treat and adults can make a boozy hot chocolate with
                    bourbon or rye.<br><br>

            
                    7) DIY Advent <br>
                    Sure, you can buy an advent calendar based on your kids' favorite activities and watch with joy as
                    they get a new goodie each day. But it's even more fun to make your own. "Each year we fill an
                    advent calendar for my son with tiny toys, sweets and notes promising trips to his favorite bakery,"
                    says Jacquelyn Rodgers, Founder at Greentop Gifts. Try this: Fill 24 advent calendar bags, boxes or
                    drawers with love notes, candy, small toys or ideas for good deeds they can do that day to spread
                    good cheer. Or, keep special ornaments aside in a box and add a new one to the tree each morning!<br><br>
                    8) Go All Out for Christmas Eve Dinner<br>
                    Some families do a Feast of the Seven Fishes, a Southern Italian tradition that likely started due
                    to the Roman Catholic mandate to abstain from meat on Christmas Eve. "We start with fried smelts
                    with a squeeze of lemon juice and scungilli salad," says Alyssa Jung, senior editor for the Hearst
                    Health Newsroom. "For dinner, we have baccala, or salted cod; roasted shrimp scampi; jumbo pesto
                    scallops; stuffed squid; and spaghetti aglio e olio. This is the one and only time we eat these
                    foods. It’s my favorite meal of the year!” If they don't do the Feast of the Seven Fishes, other
                    families might do a Polish wigilia, a Sweidsh julbord or just some of their favorite passed-down
                    recipes, but the end result is the same: food coma.<br><br>

                  
                    9) Decorate the Tree With Special Ornaments<br>
                    When it comes time to trim the tree, find a way to commemorate a milestone or memory from the past
                    year. "One of my favorite holiday traditions is adding to our ornament collection," says Jeanine
                    Hays, writer, interior and product designer of AphroChic. "In the past, ornaments have been from a
                    place we'd traveled or a gift from a dear friend. This year we are adding Black Panther to our tree.
                    I love knowing that each year our tree reveals a little bit more about our family and our heritage."
                    Making handmade ornaments together is another way to sneak some bonding time into a busy time of
                    year.<br><br>


                    10) Make Christmas Breakfast<br>
                    Opening up all those presents sure whips up an appetite. If you can tear the kids away from their
                    new toys for a minute, have everyone help out in the kitchen and make breakfast. (Put the little
                    ones in charge of the toast.) "My family does a big brunch of eggs Benedict every year," says writer
                    Chelsea Frisbie. "My mom makes it super lemony just like we like it, and we stay in our pajamas all
                    day."<br>

                    "Since I’ve begun hosting holidays, I’ve started my own tradition of preparing a festive waffle bar
                    brunch for my family and friends," says Nicole Gibbons. Who would turn down that invite?
