                    1. Roast potatoes<br>
                    Why so popular? Of all the trimmings, a roast just simply would not be a roast without the icon of
                    side dishes, and you put a perfect roast potato firmly in the top spot – ahead of even the turkey.
                    And we concur. Soft and fluffy on the inside, crispy and crunchy on the outside, whether you go
                    festive trad/slightly posh by cooking them in goose fat, or go for the (somewhat more heart healthy
                    option) of roasting them in olive oil, the humble spud is the undisputed King of Christmas dinner.<br>

                    How to serve: Jazz things up with some crushed cloves of garlic, sprinkle over some fresh rosemary
                    or thyme, go a little Italian with a dash of oregano and some lemons. You could also mix other root
                    veg in with them (saves on oven space and washing up) - try adding swede and a festive parsnip
                    (though make sure they’re pretty chunky or add them in later in the cooking process as they will
                    take less time). Or, just put them in sizzling oil and add salt. Because sometimes the simple things
                    are the best.<br><br>

                   

                    2. Carrots<br>
                    Why so popular? We all love a carrot, that most crowd pleasing of veggies – though we’re a little
                    surprised they’ve ranked quite this highly on the Christmas food list. They’re certainly one of the
                    most important veggies on the festive dinner plate, though, bringing colour as well as flavour. And,
                    for the big meal, it’s worth making them a star (so, no, over-boiled, soggy versions have no place
                    on a festive table, folks).<br>

                    How to serve: Eschewing your basic carrot for a posher version like Chantenay and cooking them whole
                    is a nice touch at Christmas (saves on prep, too). You could roast them, maybe alongside your
                    parsnips and they work well with sticky sweet marinades like maple syrup, or honey. This recipe from
                    the Hairy Bikers makes great use of an under-used spice, caraway seeds as well as butter and honey
                    to give them a lovely glaze - because what in life isn’t made better with the addition of butter and
                    honey?<br><br>

                  

                    3. Turkey<br>
                    Why so popular? Well, it is the most festive meat of all the meats, the crowning glory of Christmas
                    dinner tables up and down the land. While most of us don’t regularly tuck into a turkey dinner, come
                    December 25th, 76% of households get stuck in to one of the 10 million birds sold. One of the
                    appeals is they feed a lot of folk, for those of us who have a lot of people to cater for, and it’s
                    something different from the everyday. And so long as you know how to cook a turkey(opens in new
                    tab) properly and served with a very good gravy, it tastes very fine too. If budget allows, it’s
                    worth investing in an organic, free range bird from a small, local producer, because there will be a
                    huge difference in taste and flavour.<br>

                    How to serve: Because of the size of a turkey and the cooking time involved, it can easily dry out,
                    so it needs a lot of care in the cooking process. Cover it in butter or streaky bacon, put a
                    delicious stuffing, like the one in the below recipe, into the cavity, and make good use of flavours
                    like lemon and garlic. If space allows, take your bird out to the table as the crowning glory,
                    dressed with fresh herbs and surrounded by your roast veggies.<br><br>


                    4. Gravy<br>
                    Why so popular? Much like the potatoes, a roast wouldn’t be a roast without lashings of thick, juicy
                    gravy. Whether it’s a veggie version to add moisture to a nut roast, or one made with meat juices,
                    it’s one of the trickiest parts of the meal to do well, getting the right thickness and taste, just
                    at the time when all the other parts of the meal start coming together.<br>

                    How to serve: All you really need is the meat juices, stock and some cornflour to thicken, like in
                    this recipe below, though there are other flavours that work well – try splashing in some of that
                    old bottle of red plonk you have lying around (don’t waste your best stuff on cooking!), add a few
                    dashes of Worcestershire sauce, or some people even swear by adding a spoonful of Marmite for that
                    umami flavour. You can also throw in crushed garlic cloves from your roast veg pan, some fresh herbs
                    and a bay leaf, just strain the mix afterwards and serve in your finest gravy boat or jug. Just make
                    plenty as you’re almost certain to be asked for seconds.<br><br>

        

                    5. Stuffing<br>
                    Why so popular? An essential part of a festive dinner table if turkey or chicken are your meats of
                    choice, it’s essential for stuffing the bird, but also great oven roasted and crispy as a side dish.
                    It tends to feel special and significant because most of us don’t bother with it for a regular
                    Sunday roast. There’s a heck of a lot you can do with stuffing, and it can even be promoted to a
                    central role in your Christmas meal, especially for vegan and veggie folks (so long as you don’t
                    stick any sausage meat in there, of course).<br>

                    How to serve: Oh, the choices. From the classic sage and onion below, you could try a meaty sausage
                    and apple stuffing (that would pair beautifully with pork as well as turkey) or how about apricot
                    and hazelnut? Olives work well in stuffing too, especially for roast lamb, and throwing in some
                    pancetta works a treat. Breadcrumbs are an essential part of a stuffing, so you could swap regular
                    bread for sourdough or ciabatta as a special twist. Bake and serve straight from the dish, or roll
                    into balls and serve on a platter with pigs in blankets, and your dishes of cranberry and bread
                    sauce.
